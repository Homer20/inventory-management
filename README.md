# Inventory Management System

This is an Inventory Management System that was created using C. It allows the user to do the following: add, delete, list, update, and buy products. It features a user interface and applies 
multiple user-defined functions to perform the operations. Once the user is finished using the application, it generates a txt file of the products in their inventory.
